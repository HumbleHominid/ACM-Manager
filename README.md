# ACM-Manager
The ACM Manager aims to better connect the local club to its members. This will be achieved by allowing officers to post information about meeting and event dates easily to a centralized place for members to check. In addition, after meetings have been completed, the meeting minutes should be able to be uploaded for members that were unable to attend. Past this it would be good to be able to keep an active member list for the officers. The member list could be used to track dues and other pertinent information about members (such as attendance, t-shirt orders, etc.) This application should be able to be extended as its starts to be used in case of new use cases becoming apparent. One possibility of an extension may be to have the application help send out email reminders and meeting minutes. This application will be used by officers and members of the Montana Tech ACM, as well as the public.
