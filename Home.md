The Montana Tech Student Chapter of the ACM is our local Computer Science and Software Engineering professional organization. We host many events throughout each semester including: meetings, LAN Parties, Industry Trips, and programming competitions. This a great way to get involved on campus and meet some of the other students in the department. WIn addition to these events we help build exhibits for the Science Mine and are working towards setting up a tutoring and study group system. For more information on what is currently scheduled, check out our events tab.
