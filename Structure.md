# ACM Manager Structure  

## Home  
The home page will include general information about the club and it's activities. From here people will be able to navigate the site by using the navigation bar and also see a list of
publicly announced events that are coming up. Users will also be able to click a sign in /sign out button in the top to access their information, edit information (if they are an officer), and get direct contact information for the club and officers.  
  
## Events  
The events pages will include a list of all upcoming events and will also host detail pages to see everything, including files, associated with the events. Officers will also need to be
able to add and edit events from the listing page and from the detail pages respectively.  
  
## Files  
The files page will, by default, show any publicly listed documents associated with the club and events. If the user is logged in and is an officer, they will also see files uploaded by
other officers that are considered private.  

## Officers  
Any user that is logged in will be able to see contact information of the officers. This wil help remind members who they need to talk to about various club events.  

## Contact Us
The contact us page will give people accessing the website a form to fill out that will send an email to the club email. This is done so that no information will be put out to the
public, but will still allow people to contact the club, if needed.  

## Profile  
Members that have signed in will be able to see their profile information with the club, including paid and pending fees. Officers should be able to find people in a listing and edit
their information if necessary.  

## Sign in  
Since the website will need to be able to be updated from a set of web forms, we will need a log in system. The sign in page will facilitate this as well as registration of new members.
